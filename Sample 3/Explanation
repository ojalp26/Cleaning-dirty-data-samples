Sample 3: Badly Structured Data

This dataset was unstructured, making it difficult to analyze. The following steps were performed in Power Query to clean and transform it into a usable format:

1) Merged Columns
Two or more columns were combined into one, likely to unify fragmented data (e.g., merging first and last names or joining related categories).

2) Transposed Table
The rows and columns were swapped to restructure the dataset into a more logical format.

3) Promoted Headers
The first row was set as column headers to ensure proper labeling of the data.

4) Changed Type
Data types were adjusted (e.g., converting text to numbers or dates) to ensure consistency and prevent errors in calculations.

5) Filled Down
Missing values were filled with the previous rowâ€™s data to maintain completeness and avoid blank entries.

6) Unpivoted Other Columns
The dataset was transformed from a wide format to a long format, making it easier for analysis and visualization.

7) Split Column by Delimiter
A column was split into multiple columns based on a specific delimiter (e.g., separating names, addresses, or codes).

8) Changed Type (Again)
A final data type adjustment was made to ensure all columns had the correct format.

9) Renamed Columns
Columns were renamed for clarity, making the dataset easier to understand and work with.

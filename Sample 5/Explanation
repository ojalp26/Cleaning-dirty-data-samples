Sample 5: Jumbled Up Customer Details

This dataset contained unstructured customer details that needed to be cleaned and separated into meaningful fields. The following steps were performed in Power Query to transform the data:

1) Changed Type
The initial data types were corrected (e.g., converting text to numbers, dates, or other appropriate formats).

2) Split Column by Delimiter
A column was split into multiple columns based on a specific delimiter (e.g., separating full names, addresses, or combined data fields).

3) Changed Type (Again)
After splitting, data types were reassigned to ensure accuracy (e.g., ensuring numeric fields remain numbers).

4) Removed Columns
Irrelevant or unnecessary columns were removed to focus only on useful customer details.

5) Split Column by Delimiter (Again)
Another column was split using a delimiter to further break down complex data fields.

6) Changed Type (Repeated for Accuracy)
After splitting, data types were adjusted again to maintain consistency.

7) Split Column by Delimiter (Third Time)
Additional data fields were separated by another delimiter, further organizing customer information.

8) Changed Type (Final Corrections)
Data types were checked and corrected to ensure uniformity across all columns.

9) Split Column by Delimiter (Fourth Time)
A final split operation was applied to extract the remaining meaningful information from a combined column.

10) Changed Type (Final Check)
A last data type conversion was applied to ensure all columns had the correct format.

11) Renamed Columns
All columns were renamed to make the dataset clear, structured, and easy to understand.

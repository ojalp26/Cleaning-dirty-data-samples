Sample 7: Medicine Data with Lumped Quantity and Measure

This dataset contained medicine data where the quantity and measurement units were combined into a single column, making it difficult to analyze. The following Power Query steps were applied to clean and structure the data:


1) Changed Type
The initial data types were assigned to ensure correct formatting (e.g., text, numbers, or dates).

2) Promoted Headers
The first row was promoted to headers to properly label each column.

3) Changed Type (Again)
A second data type conversion was applied to ensure all columns had the correct formatting.

4)Split Column by Delimiter
The column containing both quantity and measurement units was split into separate columns based on a delimiter (e.g., splitting "500mg" into "500" and "mg").

5) Changed Type (After Splitting)
The split columns were assigned appropriate data types (e.g., numbers for quantities and text for units).

6) Renamed Columns
The newly created columns were renamed to make them more descriptive and easier to understand.

7) Replaced Value
Certain values were replaced to standardize the dataset (e.g., converting different unit variations like "mg." to "mg" for consistency).

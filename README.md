# Cleaning-dirty-data-samples
This project showcases my work in cleaning eight dirty data samples using Power Query in Excel. Each dataset had issues like missing values, duplicates, incorrect formats, and inconsistencies, which I systematically fixed. The goal was to transform messy data into clean, structured, and analysis-ready datasets. ðŸš€

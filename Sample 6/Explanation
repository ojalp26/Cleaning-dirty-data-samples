Sample 6: Hospital Data Mixed with Numbers and Characters

This dataset contained a mix of numbers and characters, making it difficult to analyze. The following Power Query steps were applied to clean and standardize the data:


1) Promoted Headers
The first row was promoted to headers to properly label each column.

2) Changed Type
Data types were assigned to ensure numeric values, dates, and text were recognized correctly.

3) Replaced Errors
Errors in the dataset (e.g., invalid characters in numeric fields) were identified and replaced with appropriate values (such as nulls or defaults).

4) Changed Type (Again)
Another type conversion was applied after error handling to ensure consistency.

5) Replaced Errors (Second Time)
More errors were handled, likely in different columns, ensuring clean and usable data.

6) Changed Type (Final Adjustments)
A final check was performed to assign proper data types where needed.

7) Replaced Errors (Final Pass)
Any remaining errors were replaced, ensuring the dataset was fully cleaned and ready for analysis.

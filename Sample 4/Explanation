Sample 4: Badly Structured Data

This dataset was initially unstructured and needed multiple transformations to become usable. The following steps were applied in Power Query to clean and organize it:

1) Merged Columns
Two or more columns were combined into one to unify related data (e.g., merging first and last names or combining category labels).

2) Transposed Table
The rows and columns were swapped to reorganize the dataset into a more structured format.

3) Promoted Headers
The first row was set as column headers to ensure the dataset had meaningful column names.

4) Changed Type
Data types were adjusted (e.g., converting text to numbers or dates) to maintain consistency and avoid calculation errors.

5) Filled Down
Missing values were filled with the previous rowâ€™s data to ensure completeness.

6) Unpivoted Other Columns
The dataset was transformed from a wide format to a long format, making it easier for analysis and reporting.

7) Split Column by Delimiter
A column was split into multiple columns based on a specific delimiter (e.g., separating codes, names, or categories).

8) Changed Type (Again)
Another data type adjustment was made to ensure all columns had the correct format.

9) Renamed Columns
Columns were renamed to improve clarity and make the dataset more understandable.

10) Changed Type (Final Adjustment)
A final data type check and correction were performed to ensure data consistency.

11) Renamed Columns (Again)
Additional renaming was done to align column names with standard naming conventions or business rules.

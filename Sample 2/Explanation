Sample 2: Badly Structured Data

In this dataset, the data was not structured properly, making it difficult to analyze. The following steps were performed in Power Query to clean and transform it into a usable format:

1) Transposed Table
The rows and columns were swapped to reorganize the data into a structured format. This is often necessary when data is stored in an inconvenient layout.

2) Promoted Headers
The first row was set as the column headers to ensure proper labeling of the data.

3) Changed Type
Data types were corrected for each column (e.g., converting text to numbers, dates, or categorical values) to ensure consistency and prevent errors in calculations.

4) Filled Down
Missing values were filled with the data from the row above to ensure completeness, especially in cases where repeated values were missing in a structured format.

5) Unpivoted Other Columns
The dataset was transformed from a wide format to a long format, making it easier to analyze and visualize trends over time.

6) Extracted Text Before Delimiter
A specific part of a columnâ€™s text was extracted based on a delimiter (e.g., extracting first names from full names or separating codes from descriptions).

7) Renamed Columns
Columns were renamed for better readability and clarity, making it easier to understand the dataset.

8) Changed Type (Again)
A final type conversion was applied to ensure that all columns had the correct data type, improving data integrity and preventing errors in further analysis.
